# DX11 & DX12 renderer for Lumix Engine

It's still work in progress, but most of it should work.
Use `projects/main.bat` from main repo to install this plugin

## FSR2
FSR2 can be used with DX12.
1. generate projection with `genie.exe --dx12 --fsr2 vs2022`
2. build and run studio
3. enable fsr2 instead of taa (see image)
